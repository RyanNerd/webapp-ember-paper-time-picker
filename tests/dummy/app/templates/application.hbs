<!--
  This file will be used for developers to see how to use this addon. Refer to the
  busy-componets addon to see how to make this addon serve a useful documeted usecase
  for this addon. This should be used to showcase the different use cases for this
  addon. Show examples of useing the date-picker with different passed in properties and
  different ways of using this date picker. Like with min and max dates, or just a plain simple use case
  where only the basics are passed to the picker. And give clear explanations to tell people what and how you
  are supposed to use these components.

  This component should follow the paper design for anyone else trying to use this component. It also
  should provide a clear and easy override in the sass for changing colors and fonts.


  Componets for private use should be seperated into their own folder so
  users of this addon are not confused as to what to use. There should
  be a main Component or main Componets that are in the base directory of comonents
  then there should be a folder for other components that the public should not be using.

<!-- Not sure if this or the one above is the main component for this library -->
{{paper-datetime-picker timestamp=1472245005000 minDate=1472245005000}}


<!--
  These both look like helper componets for the main one above. Refer to the above directory structure
  if these should not be used by this addons users.

<!-- this is rendering a componet that looks like it has no use to any user of this addon. -->

<!-- this is throwing an error when I dont set the day field but it doesnt tell me what I should set it to? -->
